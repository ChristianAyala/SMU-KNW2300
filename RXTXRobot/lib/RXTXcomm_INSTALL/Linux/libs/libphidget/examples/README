Included are two simple examples to get you started with Phidgets
and linux in C.

A full set of linux examples are available from www.phidets.com, as
well as examples in many other languages.

Also included here is the phidgetsbclist utility, which will list all
of the PhidgetSBCs found on the network. This utility requires that
Avahi be installed to work properly.

To flash an Arduino, follow these steps.

1) Get the Arduino IDE, found at http://arduino.cc/en/main/software. 
   Download the version for your OS, and install it appropriately.
2) Open the RXTXRobot_firmware.ino file. Click the checkmark at the top left 
   of the IDE (Verify). This will compile the firmware. Fix errors as needed.
3) Plug in an Arduino.
4) Go to Tools > Serial Port. Make sure the port corresponding to your Arduino
   is checked. On Linux, it will be something like /dev/tty.ACM#. On Mac, it
   will be /dev/tty.usbmodem#### or /dev/tty.wch* . On Windows, it will be something like COM# (check
   the Device Manager to make sure you connect to the right COM port).
5) Click the right-facing arrow at the top left of the IDE (Upload). This will
   compile and upload the firmware to the Arduino. You are done!

To setup a Raspberry Pi for flashing:
1) Make sure the Pi is connected to the internet.
2) [Do this only once] Run the raspberry_setup.sh script in the Raspberry_Flasher folder.
   It will take a time and likely require some input and reboot, so be patient.
3) Plug in an Arduino
4) Run the raspberry_flash.sh script in the Raspberry_Flasher folder. Observe output.
   You are done!

Not working?:
- If you try to upload and the IDE says "programmer not responding", try unplugging
  everything from the arduino and trying again. Sometimes a connected pin will cause a 
  short in the communication (typically a floating ground issue), and the Arduino
  is not necessarily broken.
- If that doesn't work, and the Arduino still doesn't respond, then the controller chip
  may have been shorted and fried. If possible, replace the Arduino controller
  (ATMega328). Then try again.
- If all else fails, cry and tell an adult. If you are an adult, just cry.

Other things:
- To test that the arduino works without having to use the Java API, you can 
  use terminal's screen command (on Mac and Linux) to send/receive commands.
  Use the command "screen /dev/[PORT]", where [PORT] is the port the Arduino
  is on. Then, look at the code for what possible commands are available. For
  each command, be sure to hit enter. To exit screen, hit Ctrl+a, Ctrl+\.
- For Windows machines, you can use PuTTY, which has screen.
- Alternatively, the Arduino IDE has a screen tool (Tools > Serial Monitor).
  Be sure the baud rate is set to 9600.
